# Fast-DAW-middle-tier

Node.js middle tier for 'Fast-DAW' that uses Express to connect to the front-end, Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database, and GridFS to store large media files.

This was running on an AWS EC2 instance before I took it down. It was capable of storing audio files uploaded by the user.
